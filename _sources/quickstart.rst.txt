.. note::

   This tutorial assumes you are familiar with reStructuredText (reST) and
   CMake.

According to CMinx, the contents of a CMake file can be broken into three
categories:

#. Documentation comments - what CMinx extracts

#. Annotation comments - Comments that are not documentation

#. CMake source code - Everything else

To distinguish between the two types of comments CMinx borrows the convention
that documentation comments start with an additional comment character. Thus to
indicate that a CMake comment is documentation use :code:`#[[[` (the block
comment should still end with :code:`#]]`).

The contents of the documentation comments should follow usual Python reST
conventions. In other words:

.. code:: cmake

   #[[[ 
   # Short description. Runs up to the first blank line. So this is still the
   # short description.
   #
   # Longer description goes here and includes all text and paragraphs from
   # here forward that are not part of reST directives.
   #
   # The parameters, keywords, and their types will be pulled out of the longer
   # description and placed in separate sections regardless of where they
   # appear.
   #
   # :param name_of_param: Description of what `name_of_param` is used for
   #
   # The next line is a reST directive and will not be part of the longer
   # description.
   #
   # .. note::
   #
   #    This is a note, it will show up using reST's native note section
   #]]

Technically speaking the contents of the comments are dumped more-or-less
verbatim into the resulting ``*.rst`` file so you can use any reST directives
and markup you like. That said, you will probably only want to use:

- ``:param <name of parameter>: <description of parameter>``
- ``:type <name of parameter>: <type of parameter named "name of parameter">``
- ``:keyword <name of keyword>: <description of keyword>``

as those are the subset of Python language features CMake actually supports.


.. include:: installation.rst

#####
Usage
#####

For each CMake function or variable that you would like to document, prepend it with a block doc-comment.
A block doc-comment begins with :code:`#[[[` and ends with :code:`#]]`.

Then run :code:`cminx` on your CMake files, outputting to a directory of your choosing. The help text is printed below for reference::

   Usage: cminx [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-r] file [file ...]

   positional arguments:
      file                 CMake file to generate documentation for. If
                           directory, will generate documentation for all *.cmake
                           files (case-insensitive)

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                           Directory to output generated RST to. If not specified
                           will print to standard output. Output files will have
                           the original filename with the cmake extension
                           replaced by .rst
     -r, --recursive       If specified, will generate documentation for all
                           subdirectories of specified directory recursively

#######
Example
#######

Here we show an example CMake file, called :code:`example.cmake`, that contains
doccomments documenting functions, macros, and variables.
The file contents are shown below.

example.cmake:


.. include:: ../../examples/example.cmake
   :literal:



To generate the documentation, we enter our system shell (example assumes Bash-like shell on a Unix-like system).

Generating documentation in directory :code:`output`:

.. code:: console

      foo@bar:~$ cminx -o output/ example.cmake
      Writing RST files to /home/foo/output
      Writing for file /home/foo/example.cmake
      Writing RST file /home/foo/output/example.rst

The resultant file :code: `output/example.rst`:

.. include:: ../../examples/sphinx/source/example.rst
   :literal:

Place this file in a Sphinx source directory and add it to your :code: `toctree` to render it.
