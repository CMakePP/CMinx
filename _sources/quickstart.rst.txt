Quickstart

CMinx assumes you've commented your custom CMake functions and macros like:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_samples/quickstart.cmake
   :language: cmake

Assuming that this function is defined in the file ``quickstart.cmake``, located
in your current working directory, reST documentation for this CMake module is
generated by running:

.. code:: console

   foo@bar:~$ cminx -o output_dir/ quickstart.cmake

The result will be in a file ``output_dir/quickstart.rst``.
