to use the Python classes which are part of CMinx. Compared to the content in
the ``test_samples`` directory, the contents of ``examples`` are meant to be
more tutorial like whereas the contents of ``test_samples`` are more
snippet-like.

demonstrate CMinx features. Also included for each snippet is the reST which
results from running CMinx on the snippet.
